A manifestly spurious copy, containing 201 lines, under the title of “The Life and Character of Dr S<hi rend="small-caps">WIFT</hi>,” appeared at London, in April 1733; of which the Dean complained heavily, in a letter to Mr Pope, dated May 1st; and notwithstanding Swift acknowledged in that letter he had written “a poem of near 500 lines upon the same maxim of Rochefoucault, and was a long time about it,” many readers have supposed (not attending to the circumstances of there being <hi rend="italics">two</hi> poems on the subject) that the Dean disclaimed the <hi rend="italics">Verses on his own Death</hi>. The genuine verses having been committed to the care of the celebrated author of “The Toast,” an edition was printed in 1738-9, in which more than 100 lines were omitted. Dr King assigned many judicious reasons (though some of them were merely temporary and prudential) for the mutilations: but they were so far from satisfying Dr Swift, that a complete edition was immediately printed by Faulkner, with the Dean's express permission. The poem, as it now stands in this collection, is agreeable to Mr Faulkner's copy.── N<hi rend="small-caps">ICOL</hi></note></l>

He sat afterwards on the trial of the printer of the Drapier's Fourth Letter; but the jury, against all he could say or swear, threw out the bill.
