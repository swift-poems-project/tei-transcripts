            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-12" n="12">Their gods were of wood; but our Wood is the Devil.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-13" n="13">To cut down fine wood, is a very bad thing;</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-19" n="19">Concerning this image, there went a prediction,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-20" n="20">It would burn a whole forest; nor was it a fiction.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-27" n="27">Teague made a good pun by a brogue in his speech:</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-29" n="29">Some call him a thorn, the curse of the nation,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-30" n="30">As thorns were designed to be from the creation.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-31" n="31">Some think him cut out from the poisonous yew,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-32" n="32">Beneath whose ill shade no plant ever grew.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-33" n="33">Some say he's a birch, a thought very odd;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-34" n="34">For none but a dunce would come under his rod.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-35" n="35">But I'll tell the secret; and pray do not blab:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-36" n="36">He is an old stump, cut out of a crab;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-37" n="37">And England has put this crab to hard use,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-38" n="38">To cudgel our bones, and for drink give us verjuice;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-39" n="39">And therefore his witnesses justly may boast,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-40" n="40">That none are more properly knights of the post.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-41" n="41">[But here Mr Wood complains that we mock,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-43" n="43">He can eat, drink, and sleep; now and then for a friend</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-45" n="45">He can lie like a courtier, and think it no scorn,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-334-10W1-line-47" n="47">He can rap his own raps<note place="foot">·Forge his own bad halfpence.</note>, and has the true sapience,</l>
