            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-2" n="2">We are like here, egad, to have somewhat to do:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-3" n="3">The <hi rend="italics">French</hi>, as they say, (he'll believe it that sees it)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-4" n="4">Are coming, gadsookers! to pay us a visit;</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-7" n="7">That, as I'm alive── though I ne'er was afraid yet,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-8" n="8">It almost had frighten'd me── first when I heard it.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-9" n="9">Nay, more than all this, it is certainly said</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-10" n="10">There's a little <hi rend="italics">Welsh monarch</hi> to come at their head;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-11" n="11">And he (shame the Devil, and let us speak truth)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-12" n="12">Ye know in your hearts, is a very smart youth;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-13" n="13">And doubtless will prove, when he's pleas'd to bestir him,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-14" n="14">As valiant as e'er was his father before him,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-22" n="22">He's going on some strange adventure or other,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-23" n="23">(Perhaps 'tis to seek out his father or mother)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-24" n="24">In <hi rend="italics">Ireland</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">Scotland</hi>, or some land or another;</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-26" n="26">Which you'll hear time enough, if he e'er does set out,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-27" n="27">With an army of <hi rend="italics">French</hi>, Popish bridles and knives,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-28" n="28">To cut all our throats, and to ride all our wives:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-29" n="29">Then stand to your arms, all good people, I'd wish you,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-30" n="30">Ye loyal train'd-bands, and ye valiant militia;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-31" n="31">Brush up your buff doublets, and <hi rend="italics">Scotch</hi> basket-hilt,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-32" n="32">(By which, to your honour, no blood was e'er spilt);</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-33" n="33">The nation will now your assistance want sore, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-34" n="34">Which, as I remember, they ne'er had before,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-35" n="35">Nor will──────<lb/>I hope in kind Heaven, e'er want any more:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-36" n="36">Although, for your zeal it is not to be question'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-37" n="37">You've always been ready, when aught has occasion'd:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-38" n="38">At every rejoicing you've made a fine show 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-39" n="39">(And that is one part of a soldier, we know);</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-40" n="40">Been drunk, and done all that became you to do.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-41" n="41">And as for your valour, we cannot deny it,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-42" n="42">It is known you can fight── though you'd rather be quiet.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-43" n="43">Nor has the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> threats, or their menaces, scar'd us,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-44" n="44">Because we knew well we'd a hero to guard us.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-45" n="45">Then, since they're so hot on't, 'gad, e'en let them come,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-46" n="46">I'll warrant they'll be maul'd── though I don't say by whom:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-47" n="47">We've rods here in piss that will firk off their tails,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-48" n="48">For all their brave alls── and their monarch of <hi rend="italics">Wales</hi>.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-49" n="49">Adsheart, the young hero had best take a care,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-50" n="50">That he ben't in conclusion drawn into a snare:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-51" n="51">For, as it is said, his old godsire intends 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-52" n="52">(Or at least would be glad as the matter now stands)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-53" n="53">To get shut of him handsomly off of his hands;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-54" n="54">And therefore e'en tells him, in words very plain,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-55" n="55">“That he hopes (which is true) ne'er to see him again.”</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-56" n="56">So, e'en sink or swim, fleet, forces, and all,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-57" n="57">He'll venture this cast, though it cost him a fall.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-58" n="58">To <hi rend="italics">Ireland</hi> some think this <hi rend="italics">Welsh</hi> hero is bound,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-59" n="59">But that this is a jest, one may venture five pound;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-60" n="60">For there is an old debt still on <hi rend="italics">Lewis's</hi> score: 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-61" n="61">He was bit in assisting his father before;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-62" n="62">And therefore he'll hardly come there any more.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-63" n="63">No, <hi rend="italics">Scotland's</hi> the place, they say, he's design'd to,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-64" n="64">Where 'tis thought────</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-65" n="65">He's a great many friends── which, perhaps he'll scarce find so.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-66" n="66">But let him take care what may follow hereafter,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-67" n="67">If he trust to the <hi rend="italics">Scots</hi>, he may chance catch a <hi rend="italics">Tartar</hi>:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-68" n="68">And, if he should fall in our clutches, ye know,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-69" n="69">He'd be damnably mump'd, I can tell him but so.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-70" n="70">Were I in his case, I'd not trust my own brother:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-71" n="71">They sold us one King; should they sell us another?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-72" n="72">For our <hi rend="italics">Jacks</hi> here at home── as brave fellows as may be,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-73" n="73">They prick up their ears at the news on't already;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-74" n="74">And, out of their zeal, they expect him at least</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-75" n="75">To be here, <hi rend="italics">French</hi> and all, when the wind's next at East:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-76" n="76">But some are more cautious, and question it much,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-77" n="77">And doubt the invasion's design'd on the <hi rend="italics">Dutch</hi>;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-78" n="78">For the noise of his landing, they swear, 'tis a bite all,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-79" n="79">They'll trust to't no more── till they see him at <hi rend="italics">White-hall</hi>.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-80" n="80">But this is but talk all, and so let it rest,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-81" n="81">Some are still of opinion 'twill all prove a jest:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-82" n="82">This hero at <hi rend="italics">Dunkirk</hi> will make his campaign,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-X78-71H1-line-83" n="83">And so gallop back to <hi rend="italics">St. Germain's</hi> again.</l>
