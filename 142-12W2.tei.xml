            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-39" n="39">But, when I thought proper, I altered my note;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-40" n="40">And in her own hearing I boldly did vote,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-49" n="49">Yet, since I know where a full purse may be found,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-50" n="50">And hardly pay eighteen-pence tax in the pound:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-51" n="51">Since the Tories have thus disappointed my hopes,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-53" n="53">I'll speech against peace while <hi rend="italics">Dismal</hi>'s my name,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-142-12W2-line-54" n="54">And be a true Whig, while I'm <hi rend="italics">Not-in-game</hi>.<note place="foot">·“There was printed a Grub-street speech of Lord Nottingham; and he was such an owl to complain of it in the House of Lords, who have taken up the printer for it. I heard at court, that Walpole (a great Whig member) said, that I and my whimsical club writ it at one of our meetings, and that I should pay for it. He will find he lies; and I shall let him know by a third hand my thoughts of him.”───<hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella</hi>, Dec. 18, 1711.</note></l>
