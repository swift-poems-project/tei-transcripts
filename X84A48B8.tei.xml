It was first applied to Godolphin, by Dr. Sacheverel, in his celebrated sermon, and is said to have been the true cause for his impeachment by the minister. In the Examiner for January 10, 1710, Swift writes: “We remember when a poor nick-name, borrowed from an old play of Ben Jonson, and mentioned in a sermon without any particular application, was made use of to spur on an impeachment.” Godolphin was a strenuous advocate for the Scotch union.</note> for your unbought union;</l>
