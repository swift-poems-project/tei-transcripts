            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-31" n="31">And in all the Places I liv'd I never heard of such a Thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-32" n="32">Yes, says the Steward, I remember when I was at my Lady <hi rend="italics">Shrewsbury</hi>'s,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-33" n="33">Such a Thing as this happen'd just about the Time of <hi rend="italics">Gooseberries</hi>.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-34" n="34">So I went to the Party suspected, and I found her full of Grief;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-35" n="35">(Now you must know, of all Things in the World I hate a Thief.)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolv'd to bring the Discourse slily about;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-37" n="37">Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi><note place="foot">·\<hi rend="italics">no footnote accompanies this asterisk</hi>\.</note>, said I, here's an ugly Accident has happen'd out:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I value the Money three Skips of a Louse<note place="foot">·<hi rend="italics">An usual Saying of her's</hi>.</note>;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-39" n="39">But the Thing I stand upon is the Credit of the House:</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, Service is no Inheritance in these Ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-42" n="42">Now, Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi>, you know, and every Body understands,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-43" n="43">That tho' 'tis hard to judge, yet Money can't go without Hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-44" n="44">The <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi> take me, said she, (blessing herself,) if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-45" n="45">So she roar'd like a <hi rend="italics">Bedlam</hi>, as tho'f I had call'd her all to naught:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-46" n="46">So you know what could I say to her any more?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-47" n="47">I e'en left her, and came away as wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-48" n="48">Well: But then they would have had me gone to the <hi rend="italics">Cunning-Man</hi>:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis the same Thing, the <hi rend="italics">Chaplain</hi> will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-50" n="50">So the <hi rend="italics">Chaplain</hi> came in. Now the Servants say he is my Sweet-heart,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-52" n="52">So, as the <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi> would have it, before I was aware, out I blunder'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-53" n="53"><hi rend="italics">Parson</hi>, said I, can you cast a <hi rend="italics">Nativity</hi> when a Body's plunder'd?</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-0271-line-62" n="62">With that he twisted his Girdle at me, like a Rope, as who should say,</l>
