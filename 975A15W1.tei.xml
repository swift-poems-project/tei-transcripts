            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-31" n="31">You threaten the stocks; I say you are scurrilous,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-32" n="32">And you durst not talk thus, if I saw you at our alehouse.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-34" n="34">I despise any poet that truckled to Dan.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-35" n="35">But keep a good tongue, or you'll find to your smart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-36" n="36">From rhyming in cars, you may swing in a cart.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-37" n="37">You found out my rebus with very much modesty;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-38" n="38">But thanks to the lady; I'm sure she's too good to ye:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-39" n="39">Till she lent you her help, you were in a fine twitter;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-40" n="40">You hit it, you say;── you're a delicate hitter.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-41" n="41">How could you forget so ungratefully a lass,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-42" n="42">And if you be my Phoebus, pray who was your Pallas?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-43" n="43">As for your new rebus, or riddle, or crux,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975A15W1-line-44" n="44">I will either explain, or repay it by trucks:</l>
