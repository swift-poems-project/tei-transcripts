It is on the Middlesex side, near Twickenham, where Mr Pope lived, and about two miles from Richmond Lodge. Mr Pope was the contriver of the gardens, Lord Herbert the architect, the Dean of St Patrick's chief butler, and keeper of the ice-house. Upon King George's death, these two houses met, and had the following dialogue.”</l>

              <l n="1" xml:id="spp-408-14W2-headnote-5-line-group-1-line-1">These verses were part of the flattery with which Swift and Pope were wont to assail Mrs Howard, whose influence with George II. when prince of Wales, they deemed omnipotent. How sadly they missed their aim in paying court to the favourite, instead of the Princess of Wales, has been of late completely developed in Coxe's Life of Sir Robert Walpole, and in the works of the late Horace Earl of Orford. It is, however, but justice to the memory of these distinguished men to say, that their adulation was not used for selfish ends, but for the benefit of their friend Gay; and end which may, in a certain degree, excuse the means. The opportunity of serving him through Mrs Howard's influence, seemed to be now opened by the king's death, for who could have guessed that the obnoxious favourite of the deceased monarch was only obscured for a few days, to shine forth with double lustre. These verses, therefore, were written with the purpose of keeping awake the recollection of the prince, now king, and Mrs Howard, to the connections they had formed in their comparative state of privacy, with the little band of literary and poetical friends.</l>
