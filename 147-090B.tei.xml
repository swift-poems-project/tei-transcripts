The parchment was carried to a Gentleman of Learning, who found in it the following Lines, written in a black old English Letter, and in the orthography of the Age, which seems to be about two hundred years ago, I made a shift to obtain a Copy of it; but the Transcriber, I find, hath in many Parts \<hi rend="italics">gutter</hi>\lterd the spelling to the Modern way. The \<hi rend="italics">gutter</hi>\riginal, as I am informed, is now in the hands \<hi rend="italics">gutter</hi>\f the ingenious D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> W────, F. R. S. where, I suppose \<hi rend="italics">gutter</hi>\he Curious will not be refused the Satisfaction \<hi rend="italics">gutter</hi>\f seeing it.</l>
