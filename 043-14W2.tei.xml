Swift's attachment to Congreve continued sincerely ardent, even after politics had severed them. His intercession with the Lord-Treasurer was the means of Congreve's retaining his offices under the Tory administration.</l>

Swift appears to have caught the tone of his friend from such a tirade as the following:ââ âAnd give me leave, without any flattery to you or vanity in myself, to tell my illiterate critics, as an answer to their impotent objections, that they have found fault with that which has been pleasing to you. This play, in relation to my concern for its reputation, succeeded before it was acted; for, through your early patronage, it had an audience of several persons of the first rank both in wit and quality; and their allowance of it was a consequence of your approbation. Therefore, if I really wish it might have had a more popular reception, it is not at all in consideration of myself, but because I wish well, and would gladly contribute to the benefit of the stage, and diversion of the town. They were (not long since) so kind to a very imperfect comedy of mine, that I thought myself justly indebted to them all my endeavours for an entertainment that might merit some little of that applause which they were so lavish of when I thought I had no title to it. But I find they are to be treated cheaply, and I have been at an unnecessary expense. |âI have, since the acting of this play, hearkened after the objections which have been made to it: for I was conscious where a true critic might have put me upon my defence. I was prepared for their attack, and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confessed them. But I have not heard anything said sufficient to provoke an answer. Some little snarling and backbiting there has been, but I don't know one well-mouthed cur that has opened at all.âââ Congreve's Dedication to the Right Honourable Charles Montague, prefixed to his Double Dealer.
