            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-91" n="91">Though the thought be Apollo's, 'tis finely express'd.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-92" n="92">So a thief steals my horse, and has him well dress'd.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-93" n="93">Now, whereas the said criminal seems past repentance,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-95" n="95">Since Delany has dar'd, like Prometheus his sire,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-96" n="96">To climb to our region, and thence to steal fire;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-97" n="97">We order a vulture, in shape of the spleen,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-98" n="98">To prey on his liver, but not to be seen.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-99" n="99">And we order our subjects of ev'ry degree</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-100" n="100">To believe all his verses were written by me:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-101" n="101">And, under the pain of our highest displeasure,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-102" n="102">To call nothing his but the rhyme and the measure.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-103" n="103">And lastly, for Stella just out of her prime,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-104" n="104">I'm too much reveng'd already by time.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-105" n="105">In return to her scorn, I sent her diseases;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-106" n="106">But will now be her friend, whenever she pleases:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-06E2-line-107" n="107">And the gifts I bestow'd her will find her a lover,</l>
