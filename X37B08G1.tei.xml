I am glad you have got the piles, because it is a mark of health, and a strong constitution. I believe what you say of the <hi rend="italics">legion-club</hi> poem; for it plainly appears a work of a <hi rend="italics">legion-club</hi>; for I hear there are fifty different copies: but what's that to me? And you are in the right, that they are not treated according to their merit. You never writ so regularly in your life; and therefore when you write to me, always take care to have the <hi rend="italics">piles</hi>; I mean any <hi rend="italics">piles</hi><ref target="#spp-X37B08G1-footnote-headnote-1">1</ref><note n="1" xml:id="spp-X37B08G1-footnote-headnote-1" place="foot">The author held puns in contempt, but would sometimes make himself merry with them</note>, except those of lime and stone; and yet <hi rend="italics">piles</hi> are not so bad as the <hi rend="italics">stone</hi>. I find you intend to be here (by your date) in a dozen days hence. The room shall be ready for you; though I shall never have you in a morning, or at dinner, or in an evening; at all other times I shall be pestered with you. John R──── (for he does not deserve the name of Jack) is gone to his six-miles-off country-seat for the summer. I admire at your bill off 10 l. odd; for I thought your first was double: or is it an additional one? When you satisfy me, I will send down to him with a vengeance; although, except that damned vice of avarice, he is a very agreeable man.──────── As to your venison, <hi rend="italics">vain is one</hi> who expects it. I am <hi rend="italics">checking</hi> you for your <hi rend="italics">chickens</hi>, and could <hi rend="italics">lamb</hi> you for your <hi rend="italics">lambs</hi>.</l>
