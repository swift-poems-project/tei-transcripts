The provocation given to Dean Percival was a reflection upon his pedantry and his wife's housewifery. Swift says, “Dean Percival has answered the other Dean's Journal in Grub-street, justly taxing him for avarice and want of hospitality. Madam Percival absolutely denies all the facts; insists that she never made candles of dripping; that Charley never had the chincough, &amp;c.”── Vol. XVI. p. 419.

            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-32" n="32">In short he lived, and that's what few can</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-34" n="34">He sometimes to a chapter goes</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-35" n="35">With saucy strut and turn'd-up nose,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-36" n="36">Leans on his cushion, then he'll bid ye,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-38" n="38">Perhaps he'll sneer or break a jest,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-39" n="39">But de'il a bit to break your fast.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-41" n="41">What hour it will, 'tis all alike.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-42" n="42">Some country Preb. comes just at one</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-43" n="43">In hopes to dine, and so be gone.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-44" n="44">The Dean appears:── “I'm glad to see you,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-45" n="45">Pray tell what service I can do you.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-46" n="46">Be quick, for I am going out.”</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-47" n="47">The hungry Levite's vexed no doubt,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-48" n="48">To be thus baulked; tucks up his gown,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-49" n="49">Makes a low scrape, and so to town:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-50" n="50">Is welcome there, so makes a shift</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-51" n="51">To drink a glass and rail at Swift.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-52" n="52">But of this farce you'll know the reason,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-53" n="53">You shall, I'm sure it can't be treason.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-54" n="54">He dines abroad you think── mistaken,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-55" n="55">He dines at home on sprouts and bacon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-56" n="56">Besides, his two chief slaves are missing,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-57" n="57">To boil his drink and broil his grisking,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-58" n="58">Pert Jack and Robin, I mean Grattan,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-59" n="59">As suppliant slaves as e'er had hat on;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-60" n="60">Such slaves as these you know delights him,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-61" n="61">Who're sure to trudge when he invites 'em</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-62" n="62">And that's as often as in his kitchen,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-63" n="63">A fire is made to broil a pigeon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-64" n="64">The seventeenth of March each year,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-65" n="65">The chapter meets to make good cheer.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-66" n="66">The Dean's allowed five pounds or more,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-67" n="67">To entertain about half a score.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-68" n="68">You're sure to meet a handsome dish,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-69" n="69">Of salmon, or some other fish;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-70" n="70">A dish of sup, a leg of mutton,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-71" n="71">By servants are the table put on;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-72" n="72">A plate with puddings then next comes,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-73" n="73">One plain, one almond, t'other plumbs:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-74" n="74">The second course adorns the table,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-75" n="75">With loin of beef most formidable;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-76" n="76">A sallad, with a dish of fowl,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-77" n="77">Of this huge treat makes up the whole.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-78" n="78">Now if some critic should accost him,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-79" n="79">And ask how much this dinner cost him,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-80" n="80">He could not say that he had lost,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-81" n="81">Any great matter by the roast;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-82" n="82">The treat, just as the Dean bespoke it,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-83" n="83">Put two pound ten into his pocket,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-84" n="84">Besides, the fragments of the feast</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-85" n="85">Will feed his house a week at least.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-86" n="86">As for himself, with draggled gown,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-87" n="87">Poor curate-like he'll trudge the town,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-88" n="88">To eat a meal with punster base,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-89" n="89">Or buffoon call him if you please.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-90" n="90">Sometimes to Gallstown he will go,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-91" n="91">To spend a month or two, or so,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-92" n="92">Admires the baron, George and's spouse,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-93" n="93">Lives well, and then lampoons the house.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-M60501W1-line-94" n="94">Thus far our bard in doggrel rhyme,</l>
