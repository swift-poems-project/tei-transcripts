This fact, however true, was not in Dr. Swift's time ascertained with any degree of precision. Ireland even to this day “remains superstitiously devoted to her antient history,” and “wraps herself in the gloom of her own legendary annals.” Mr. Whitaker has displayed an uncommon fund of knowledge on this very curious subject, both in his “History of Manchester,” and in “The Genuine History of the Britons asserted.” N.</note>.</l>

Relying upon uncertain legends, and the traditions of their bards, still more uncertain, they reckon up a series of kings several ages <hi rend="italics">before</hi> the birth of Christ; and give a particular detail of occurrences, which happened in their reigns. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, John Major and Hector Boëthius published their Histories of Scotland: the former a succinct and dry writer, the latter a copious and florid one; and both equally credulous. Not many years after, Buchanan undertook the same work; and if his accuracy and impartiality had been in any degree equal to the elegance of his taste, and to the purity and vigour of his style, his history might be placed on a level with the most admired compositions of the ancients. But, instead of rejecting the improbable tales of Chronicle-writers, he was at the utmost pains to adorn them, and hath cloathed with all the beauties and graces of fiction those legends which formerly had only its wildness and extravagance.”── On the authority of Buchanan and his predecessors the historical part of this poem seems founded, as well as the notes signed I<hi rend="small-caps">RISH</hi> E<hi rend="small-caps">D</hi>. some of which, I believe, were written by the Dean himself.
