                <note rend="flush left">[1] 20 20The troubles following upon the revolution led to an exodus of refugees from Ireland; and with them came Swift early in 1689. After a visit to his mother at Leicester he entered the household of Sir William Temple at Moor Park before the close of the same year. In May, 1690, he returned to Ireland armed with a letter (<hi rend="italics">Corresp.</hi> i. 1) of recommendation from Temple to Sir Robert Southwell, Secretary of State. He was back in England about August, 1691; and, after visits to Leicester and Oxford, he reached Moor Park in December.[2] 20 20On 1 July (o.s.), 1690, while Swift was in Ireland, was sought the battle of the Boyne. He is known to have written an ode celebrating William's Irish successes, composed presumably 1690-1. In his 'Ode to the Athenian Society' he refers to 'an <hi rend="italics">Humble Chaplet for the King</hi>', and explains the allusion with a marginal note,---'<hi rend="italics">The Ode I writ to the King in</hi> Ireland'. Furthermore, Deane Swift, writing 7 June, 1778, says that 'five or six and forty years ago' Mrs. Whiteway showed him the Dean's 'Ode to King William', apparently in printed form, but that, owing to its 'Pindarique way' he was unable to drudge through more than fifty or sixty lines of it (Nichols's <hi rend="italics">Literary Illustrations</hi>, v. 382). He had previously in his <hi rend="italics">Essay on the Life of Swift</hi>, 1755, p. 118, counted the 'Ode to King William' with the pindarics, although he was mistaken in supposing that it had appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Athenian Oracle</hi>. But when as an editor, in 1765, he added a number of verse pieces hitherto omitted from the <hi rend="italics">Works</hi> he made no attempt to recover the ode addressed to King William, perhaps because he regarded it as unreadable.[3] 20 20In 1780, however, the industrious John Nichols, in his <hi rend="italics">Select Collection of Poems</hi>, printed an 'Ode to King William, On his Successes in Ireland', with the following footnote: 'With much pleasure I here present to the publick an Ode which had long been sought after without success. That it is Swift's, I have not the least doubt; ... He refers to it in the second stanza of his "Ode to the Athenian Society", ... See the "English Poets", vol. xxxix, p. 10; and "The Gentleman's Journal", July, 1692, p. 13.' At the reference given by Nichols to Johnson's <hi rend="italics">English Poets</hi> a footnote merely states that the ode to the king 'cannot now be recovered'; in <hi rend="italics">The Gentleman's Journal, loc. cit</hi>., appears the poem which Nichols claimed for Swift. It is entitled 'TO THE KING', and a prefatory note informs the reader that 'I have here some Verses upon the KING's Success in <hi rend="italics">Ireland:</hi> You will find that tho they were written long ago, they carry their Recommendation by their Value, and it had been Pity to have conceal'd them, as their Author does himself'. Following upon the text of the poem, which runs to twelve four-line stanzas, some clue is offered to the author: 'I need not tell you that the Gentleman that wrote these Verses, hath merited highly the name of <hi rend="italics">Vates</hi> in every respect. The intire Reduction of <hi rend="italics">Ireland</hi>, and our late Victory over the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> at Sea, make it obvious enough'. This does not carry us very far; but, if anything, suggests reference to an older and better-known person than was Swift at the time. Nor does the poem in the least resemble the ode which Deane Swift avers that he and Mrs. Whiteway understood to be Swift's. It is not pindaric in form; and it does not run to the fifty or sixty lines after which Deane Swift desisted from reading. Furthermore, we know that at this time Swift was immersed in ambitious imitations of Cowley. An ode to the king would almost certainly have been thrown into pindaric form, as he understood it. And, if it were, we should get the most probable grouping of his six early odes. Four in pindarics would then be followed by two in heroic couplets,░ suggesting that he had learned to abandon a form unnatural to him. There is indeed no evidence to support Nichols's confident attribution to Swift of the poem he unearthed from <hi rend="italics">The Gentleman's Journal</hi>. He included it, however, as Swift's, in the volume of <hi rend="italics">Miscellaneous Pieces</hi>, 1789, which was published as a supplement to Sheridan's edition of the Dean's <hi rend="italics">Works</hi>, 1784, whence it has been adopted by subsequent editors.[4] 20 20Between 1728 and 1735 Samuel Fairbrother, the Dublin printer, published four volumes of <hi rend="italics">Miscellanies</hi>, the earlier volumes drawn from the Swift and Pope miscellany volumes published in London, the fourth extracted from the edition of Swift's <hi rend="italics">Works</hi> in four volumes published in Dublin, by Faulkner, in 1735. Fairbrother claimed, over and above his borrowings from Faulkner, to have added in his fourth volume several poems 'taken from the D---ns own Original Manuscripts'. An examination of the verse section of his 1735 volume leaves no doubt that he had access to manuscripts unused by Faulkner.░ The first poem printed by him is a pindaric 'Ode to the King on his Irish Expedition'. Its turgid style reads uncommonly like Swift's other attempts in the same form; and it is reasonable to believe that this is the lost ode for which Nichols and others sought in vain. It has the merit also of answering to Deane Swift's description.[5] 20 20This may be Swift's lost ode, and Nichols was probably wrong; but convincing evidence is lacking. Both pieces are, therefore, here printed, the pindaric ode first, as it appeared in <hi rend="italics">Vol. IV. of the Miscellanies Begun by Jonathan Swift, D.D. and Alexander Pope, Esq. ... Dublin, Printed by and for Samuel Fairbrother, ... 1735</hi>, Verse section, pp. 1-6.</note>
