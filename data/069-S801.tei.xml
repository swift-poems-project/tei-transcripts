            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-3" n="3">So because I had been buying things for my <hi rend="italics">Lady</hi> last Night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-4" n="4">I was resolv'd to tell my Money, to see if it was right:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-5" n="5">Now you must know, because my Trunk has a very bad Lock, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-6" n="6">Therefore all the Money I have, which, <hi rend="italics">God</hi> knows, is a very small Stock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-7" n="7">I keep in a Pocket ty'd about my middle, next my Smock.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-8" n="8">So when I put up my Purse, as <hi rend="italics">God</hi> would have it, my·my Smock was unript,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-9" n="9">And instead of putting it into my Pocket, down it slipt:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-10" n="10">Then the Bell rung, and I went down stairs to put my <hi rend="italics">Lady</hi> to Bed,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-11" n="11">When, <hi rend="italics">God</hi> knows, I thought my Mony was as safe as my Maidenhead.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-12" n="12">So when I came up again, I found my Pocket very light,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-13" n="13">But when I search'd and miss'd my Purse, <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>!<hi rend="italics"/> I thought I should have sunk outright:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-14" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Lord! Madam</hi>, says <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, how d'ye do? Indeed, says I, never worse;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-15" n="15">But pray, <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, can you tell what I have done with my Purse!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-16" n="16"><hi rend="italics">Lord</hi> help me, said <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, I never stirr'd out of this Place!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-17" n="17">Nay, said I, I had it in Lady <hi rend="italics">Betty</hi>'s Chamber, that's a plain Case.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-18" n="18">So <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> got me to Bed, and cover'd me up warm,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-19" n="19">However, she stole away my Garters, that I might do my self no Harm:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-20" n="20">So I tumbled and toss'd all Night, as you may very well think,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever set my Eyes together, or slept a Wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-22" n="22">So I was dream'd, methought, that we went and search'd the Folks round,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-23" n="23">And in a Corner of Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Duke</hi>'s Box, ty'd in a Rag, the Mony was found.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-24" n="24">So next Morning we told <hi rend="italics">Whittle</hi>, and he fell a swearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-25" n="25">Then Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Wadgar</hi> came, and she, you know, is thick o' hearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-26" n="26"><hi rend="italics">Dame</hi>, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a Loss I have had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she, my Lord <note place="foot">·<hi rend="italics">Gallaway</hi>.</note> <hi rend="italics">Collway</hi>'s Folks are all very sad.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-28" n="28">For my Lord <note place="foot">·<hi rend="italics">Droghda</hi>.</note> <hi rend="italics">Dromedary</hi> comes a <hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi> without fail;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-29" n="29">Pugh! said I, but that's not the Business I ail.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-30" n="30">Says <hi rend="italics">Cary</hi>, says he, I have been a Servant this Five and Twenty years, come Spring,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-31" n="31">And in all the Places I liv'd, I never heard of such a Thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-32" n="32">Yes, says the <hi rend="italics">Steward</hi>, when I was at my Lady <hi rend="italics">Shrewsbury</hi>'s.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-33" n="33">Such a Thing as this happen'd just about the time of <hi rend="italics">Goosberries</hi>.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-34" n="34">So I went to the Party suspected, and found her full of Grief;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-35" n="35">Now you know of all things in the World I hate a Thief:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolv'd to bring the Discourse slily about,</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-37" n="37">Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Duke</hi>'s, said I, here's an ugly Accident has happen-ed out;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I value the Mony Three Skips of a Louse.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-39" n="39">But the thing I stand upon, is the Credit of the House;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-40" n="40">'Tis true, 7 <hi rend="italics">l</hi>. and 4 <hi rend="italics">s</hi>. and 6 <hi rend="italics">d</hi>. makes a great Hole in my Wages,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, Service is no Inheritance in these Ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-42" n="42">Now Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi>, you know, and every Body understands,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-43" n="43">That tho' 'tis hard to judge── Mony can't go without Hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-44" n="44">The <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi> take me, said she, blessing her self, if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-45" n="45">So she roar'd like a Bedlam, as tho' I had call'd her to naught;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-46" n="46">So you know, what could I say to her any more,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-47" n="47">I e'en left her, and came away as wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-48" n="48">Well: But then they would have had me gone to the Cunning Man;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis the same thing, the <hi rend="italics">Chaplain</hi> will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-50" n="50">So the <hi rend="italics">Chaplain</hi> came in; now the Servants say, he is my Sweet-heart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-51" n="51">Because he's always in my Chamber, and I always take his Part;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-52" n="52">So, as the <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi> would have it, before I was aware, out I blunder'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-53" n="53"><hi rend="italics">Parson</hi>, said I, can you cast a <hi rend="italics">Nativity</hi>, when a Body's plunder'd?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-54" n="54">Now you must know, he hates to be call'd <hi rend="italics">Parson</hi>, like the <hi rend="italics">Devil</hi>,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-55" n="55">Truly, said he, Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Nab</hi>. it might become you to be more civil:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-56" n="56">If your Mony be gone, as a <hi rend="italics">Learned Divine</hi> says, d'ye see,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-57" n="57">You are no Text for my handling, take that from me:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-58" n="58">I was never taken for a <hi rend="italics">Conjurer</hi> before, I'd have you to know.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-59" n="59"><hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>, said I, don't be angry, I'm sure I never thought you so;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-60" n="60">You know, I honour the Cloth, I design to be a <hi rend="italics">Parson</hi>'s Wife,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-61" n="61">I never took one in <hi rend="italics">your Coat</hi> for a <hi rend="italics">Conjurer</hi> in all my Life:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-62" n="62">With that, he twisted his Girdle like a Rope, as who should say,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-63" n="63">Now you may go hang your self for me, and so went away.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-64" n="64">Well, I thought I should have swoon'd; <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>, said I, what shall I do?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-65" n="65">I have lost my <hi rend="italics">Mony</hi>, and shall lose my <hi rend="italics">True-Love</hi> too.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-66" n="66">Then my <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi> call'd me; <hi rend="italics">Harris</hi>, said my <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>, don't cry,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-67" n="67">I'll give something towards thy Loss; and says my <hi rend="italics">Lady</hi>, so will I.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-S801-line-69" n="69">For that, he said, (and't please your <hi rend="italics">Excellencies</hi>) I must petition you.</l>
