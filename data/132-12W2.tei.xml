The fruits of his resentment was the following lampoon on the treasurer's abdication. It was read at Harley's, on the 15th October, 1710; but was not then suspected to be Swift's. The success of this <hi rend="italics">jeu d'esprit</hi> was prodigious. The allusion to Godolphin's family name, Sidney, and to his staff of office, are sufficiently obvious.</l>
