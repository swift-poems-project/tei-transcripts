            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-49" n="49">That the letters appear'd revers'd through the pane</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-50" n="50">But in Stella's bright eyes were plac'd right again</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-52" n="52">And presently guess'd the fancy was mine</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-55" n="55">Now you see why his verses so seldom are shewn</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-56" n="56">The reason is plain, they are none of his own</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-57" n="57">And observe while you live that no man is shy</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-58" n="58">To discover the goods he came honestly by</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-59" n="59">If I light on a thought he'll certainly steal it</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-60" n="60">And when he has got it, find ways to conceal it</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-61" n="61">Of all the fine things he keeps in the dark</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-62" n="62">There's scarce one in ten but what has my mark</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-63" n="63">And let them be seen by the World if he dare</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-64" n="64">I'll make it appear they're all stolen ware</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-65" n="65">But as for the Poem he writ on your Sash</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-66" n="66">I think I have now got him under my lash</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-67" n="67">My Sister transcrib'd it last night to his sorrow</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-68" n="68">And the Publick shall see it, if I live 'till to morrow</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-69" n="69">Thro' the Zodiac around it shall quickly be spread</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-70" n="70">In all parts of the Globe where your language is read</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-71" n="71">He knows very well I ne'er gave a refusal</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-72" n="72">When ask'd for my aid, in the forms that are usuall</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-73" n="73">But the secret is this, I did lately intend</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-74" n="74">To write a few verses on you as my friend</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-75" n="75">I study'd a fortnight before I could find</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-76" n="76">As I rode on my chariot a thought to my mind</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-77" n="77">And resolv'd the next winter, for that is my time</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-78" n="78">When the days are at shortest, to get it in rhyme</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-79" n="79">'Till then it was lockt in my box at Parnassus</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-80" n="80">When the subtle companion in hopes to surpass us</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-82" n="82">For I think in my conscience he deals with old Nick</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-83" n="83">And from my own stock provided with Topicks</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-84" n="84">He gets to the window beyond both the Tropicks</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-85" n="85">There, out of my sight just against the North-zone</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-88" n="88">Now who but Delany that writes like Apollo</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-89" n="89">High Treason by statutes, but here you object</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-90" n="90">He only stole hints, but the verse is correct</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-91" n="91">Tho' the thoughts be Apollo's, they're finely exprest</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-92" n="92">So a thief steals my horse, and has him well drest</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-93" n="93">Now whereas the s<hi rend="superscript">ḍ</hi> criminal seems past repentance</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-008D-line-95" n="95">Since Delany has dar'd like Prometheus his sire</l>
