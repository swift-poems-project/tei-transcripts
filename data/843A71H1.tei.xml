He was invited to <hi rend="italics">London</hi> by secretary <hi rend="italics">Hedges</hi> in 1700, to whom he was chaplain; and obtained from the earl of <hi rend="italics">Sunderland</hi> the parsonage of <hi rend="italics">St. Olave, Southwark</hi>, and the arch-<lb/>deaconry of <hi rend="italics">Surrey</hi>. He attended king <hi rend="italics">George</hi> I. to <hi rend="italics">Hanover</hi> in 1719, taught the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> language to prince <hi rend="italics">Frederick</hi>; and was promoted to the deanry of <hi rend="italics">Christ Church</hi> and bishoprick of <hi rend="italics">Bristol Oct</hi>. 20, the same year; and to the archbishoprick of <hi rend="italics">Armagh, Aug</hi>. 21, 1724. The latter promotion he would have declined; but his judgement, moderation, and address, being thought necessary to quench the flame which <hi rend="italics">Wood's</hi> ruinous project had occasioned, the king laid his commands on him, to which he reluctantly submitted. He made a visit to his native country in <hi rend="italics">June</hi> 1742, and died in <hi rend="italics">London</hi> the <hi rend="italics">September</hi> following. His public charities in <hi rend="italics">Ireland</hi> amounted to upwards of thirty thousand pounds.── When a young man, he joined with <hi rend="italics">Ambrose Philips</hi>, who was afterwards his secretary, and others, in a Paper called “The Free-thinker,” since collected in three volumes. His “State Letters” have been lately published, in two volumes octavo.</note>, “The mob is grown bold,”</l>

The populace, encouraged by some dealers in exchange, who were the principal losers, grew clamorous; but, experience evincing the utility of the project, the people soon recovered their senses, and he rose to the greatest height of popularity.</note>.”</l>
