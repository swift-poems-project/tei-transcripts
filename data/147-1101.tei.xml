In digging the Grave, the Sexton struck against a small leaden Coffer, about half a Foot in Length, and four Inches wide. The poor Man expecting he had discovered a Treasure, opened it with some Difficulty; but found only a small Parchment, rolled up very fast, put into a Leather Case; which Case was tied at the Top, and sealed with a St. <hi rend="italics">George</hi>, the Impression on black Wax, very rude and Gothick. The Parchment was carried to a Gentleman of Learning, who found in it the following Lines, written in a black old <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Letter, and in the Orthography of the Age, which seems to be about two hundred Years ago. I made a Shift to obtain a Copy of it; but the Transcriber, I find, hath in many Parts altered the Spelling to the modern Way. The Original, as I am informed, is now in the Hands of the ingenious Dr. <hi rend="italics">W</hi>── F. R. S. where, I suppose, the Curious will not be refused the Satisfaction of seeing it.</l>

Their Meaning is very dark, if it be any at all; of which the learned Reader can judge better than I: However it be, several Persons were of Opinion, that they deserved to be published, both as they discover somewhat of the Genius of a former Age, and may be an Amusement to the present.</l>
