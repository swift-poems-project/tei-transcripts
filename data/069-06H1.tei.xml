            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-2" n="2">And I had in a purse seven pound, four shillings, and six pence, besides farthings, in money and gold:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-3" n="3">So, because I had been buying things for my <hi rend="italics">lady</hi> last night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-4" n="4">I was resolv'd to tell my money, to see if it was right.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-5" n="5">Now you must know, because my trunk has a very bad lock, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-6" n="6">Therefore all the money I have, which, God knows, is a very small stock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-7" n="7">I keep in my pocket, ty'd about my middle, next to my smock.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-8" n="8">So, when I went to put up my purse, as God would have it, my smock was unript,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-9" n="9">And, instead of putting it into my pocket, down it slipt:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-10" n="10">Then the bell rung, and I went down to put my <hi rend="italics">lady</hi> to bed;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-11" n="11">And, God knows, I thought my money was as safe as my maidenhead.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-12" n="12">So, when I came up again, I found my pocket feel very light:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-13" n="13">But when I search'd, and miss'd my purse, <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>! I thought I shou'd have sunk outright.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-14" n="14"><hi rend="italics">Lord! madam</hi>, says <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, how d'ye do? indeed, says I, never worse:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-15" n="15">But pray, <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, can you tell what I have done with my purse?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-16" n="16"><hi rend="italics">Lord</hi> help me! said <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi>, I never stirr'd out of this place:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-17" n="17">Nay, said I, I had it in lady <hi rend="italics">Betty</hi>'s chamber, that's a plain case.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-18" n="18">So <hi rend="italics">Mary</hi> got me to bed, and cover'd me up warm:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-19" n="19">However, she stole away my garters, that I might do myself no harm.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-20" n="20">So I tumbled and toss'd all night, as you may very well think,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever set my eyes together, or slept a wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-22" n="22">So I was a-dream'd, methought, that we went and search'd the folks round,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-23" n="23">And in a corner of mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi>'s box ty'd in a rag the money was found.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-24" n="24">So next morning we told <hi rend="italics">Whittle</hi><note place="foot">·Earl of <hi rend="italics">Berkeley</hi>'s valet.</note>, and he fell a swearing:</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-25" n="25">Then my dame <hi rend="italics">Wadgar</hi> <note place="foot">·The old deaf house-keeper.</note> came; and she, you know, is thick of hearing:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-26" n="26"><hi rend="italics">Dame</hi>, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a loss I have had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she, my lord <note place="foot">·<hi rend="italics">Galway</hi>.</note> <hi rend="italics">Colway</hi>'s folks are all very sad;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-28" n="28">For my lord <note place="foot">·<hi rend="italics">Drogheda</hi>, who with the primate was to succeed the two earls.</note> <hi rend="italics">Dromedary</hi> comes a <hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi> without fail.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-29" n="29">Pugh! said I, but that's not the bus'ness that I ail,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-30" n="30">Says <hi rend="italics">Cary</hi><note place="foot">·Clerk of the kitchen.</note>, says he, I have been a servant this five and twenty years, come spring,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-31" n="31">And in all the places I liv'd I never heard of such a thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-32" n="32">Yes, says the <hi rend="italics">steward</hi>, I remember, when I was at my lady <hi rend="italics">Shrewsbury</hi>'s,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-33" n="33">Such a thing as this happen'd just about the time of <hi rend="italics">goosberries</hi>.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-34" n="34">So I went to the party suspected, and I found her full of grief,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-35" n="35">(Now you must know, of all things in the world, I hate a thief)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolv'd to bring the discourse slily about:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-37" n="37">Mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi><note place="foot">·A servant, wife to one of the footmen.</note>, said I, here's an ugly accident has happen'd out:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I value the money three skips of a louse<note place="foot">·An usual saying of hers.</note>;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-39" n="39">But the thing I stand upon is the credit of the house.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-40" n="40">'Tis true, seven pounds, four shillings, and six pence, makes a great hole in my wages:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, service is no inheritance in these ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-42" n="42">Now, mrs. <hi rend="italics">Dukes</hi>, you know, and every body understands,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-43" n="43">That though 'tis hard to judge, yet money can't go without hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-44" n="44">The <hi rend="italics">devil</hi> take me, said she, (blessing herself) if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-45" n="45">So she roar'd like a <hi rend="italics">Bedlam</hi>, as though I had call'd her all to naught.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-46" n="46">So you know, what cou'd I say to her any more?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-47" n="47">I e'en left her, and came away as wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-48" n="48">Well; but then they would have had me gone to the cunning man:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis the same thing, the <hi rend="italics">chaplain</hi> will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-50" n="50">So the <hi rend="italics">chaplain</hi> <note place="foot">·The author.</note> came in. Now the servants say he is my sweetheart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-51" n="51">Because he's always in my chamber, and I always take his part.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-52" n="52">So, as the <hi rend="italics">devil</hi> would have it, before I was aware, out I blunder'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-53" n="53"><hi rend="italics">Parson</hi>, said I, can you cast a <hi rend="italics">nativity</hi>, when a body's plunder'd?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-54" n="54">(Now you must know, he hates to be call'd <hi rend="italics">parson</hi> like the <hi rend="italics">devil</hi>)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-55" n="55">Truly, says he, mrs. <hi rend="italics">Nab</hi>, it might become you to be more civil:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-56" n="56">If your money be gone, as a learned <hi rend="italics">divine</hi> says, d'ye see,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-57" n="57">You are no <hi rend="italics">text</hi> for my handling; so take that from me:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-58" n="58">I was never taken for a <hi rend="italics">conjurer</hi> before, I'd have you to know.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-59" n="59"><hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>! said I, don't be angry, I am sure I never thought you so;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-60" n="60">You know, I honour the cloth; I design to be a <hi rend="italics">parson</hi>'s wife;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-61" n="61">I never took one in your <hi rend="italics">coat</hi> for a <hi rend="italics">conjurer</hi> in all my life.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-62" n="62">With that, he twisted his girdle at me like a rope, as who should say,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-63" n="63">Now you may go hang yourself for me, and so went away.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-64" n="64">Well: I thought I should have swoon'd, <hi rend="italics">Lord</hi>! said I, what shall I do?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-65" n="65">I have lost my <hi rend="italics">money</hi>, and shall lose my <hi rend="italics">true love</hi> too.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-66" n="66">Then my <hi rend="italics">lord</hi> call'd me: <hi rend="italics">Harry</hi><note place="foot">·A cant word of my lord and lady to mrs. <hi rend="italics">Harris</hi>.</note>, said my <hi rend="italics">lord</hi>, don't cry,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-67" n="67">I'll give you something towards thy loss; and says my <hi rend="italics">lady</hi>, so will I.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-68" n="68">Oh! but, said I, what if, after all, my chaplain won't <hi rend="italics">come to</hi>?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-69" n="69">For that, he said, (an't please your <hi rend="italics">excellencies</hi>,) I must petition you.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-70" n="70">The premises tenderly consider'd, I desire your <hi rend="italics">excellencies</hi> protection,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-71" n="71">And that I may have a share in next <hi rend="italics">Sunday</hi>'s collection;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-06H1-line-72" n="72">And, over and above, that I may have your <hi rend="italics">excellencies</hi> letter,</l>
