How many Pretenders to Learning expose themselves by chusing to discourse on those very Parts of Science wherewith they are least acquainted? It is the same Case in every other Qualification. By the Multitude of those who deal in Rhimes from Half a Sheet to Twenty, which come out every Minute, there must be at least Five hundred Poets in the City and Suburbs of <hi rend="italics">London</hi>; half as many Coffee-House Orators, exclusive of the Clergy; Forty thousand Politicians; and Four thousand Five hundred profound Scholars: Not to mention the Wits, the Railliers, the smart Fellows, and Criticks; all as illiterate and impudent as a Suburb Whore. What are we to think of the fine dressed Sparks, proud of their own Personal Deformities, which appear the more hideous by the <hi rend="italics">Contrast</hi> of wearing Scarlet and Gold, with what they call <ref target="#spp-601-0852-footnote-headnote-1">1</ref><note n="1" xml:id="spp-601-0852-footnote-headnote-1" place="foot">Wigs with long black Tails, worn for some Years past. <hi rend="italics">November</hi> 1738</note> Toupees on their Heads, and all the Frippery of a modern Beau, to make a Figure before Women; some of them with Hump-Backs, others hardly five Foot high, and every Feature of their Faces distorted; I have seen many of these insipid Pretenders entering into Conversation with Persons of Learning, constantly making the grossest Blunders in every Sentence, without conveying one single Idea fit for a rational Creature to spend a Thought on; perpetually confounding all Chronology and Geography even of present Times. I compute, that <hi rend="italics">London</hi> hath eleven native Fools of the Beau and Puppy-Kind, for one among us in <hi rend="italics">Dublin</hi>; besides two thirds of ours transplanted thither, who are now naturalized; whereby that overgrown Capital exceedeth ours in the Article of Dunces by forty to one; and what is more to our further Modification, there is not one distinguished Fool of <hi rend="italics">Irish</hi> Birth or Education, who maketh any Noise in that famous Metropolis, unless the <hi rend="italics">London</hi> Prints be very partial or defective; whereas <hi rend="italics">London</hi> is seldom without a Dozen of their own educating, who engross the Vogue for half a Winter together, and are never heard of more, but give Place to a new Sett. This hath been the constant Progress for at least Thirty Years past, only allowing for the Change of Breed and Fashion.</l>
