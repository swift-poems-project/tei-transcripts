            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-1" n="1"><hi rend="italics">Humbly showeth</hi><lb/>That I went to warm myself in Lady Betty's chamber, because I was cold,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-2" n="2">And I had in a purse seven pound, four shillings and sixpence besides farthings) in money and gold;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-3" n="3">So because I had been buying things for my Lady last night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-4" n="4">I was resolved to tell my money, to see if it was right.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-5" n="5">Now you must know, because my trunk has a very bad lock, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-6" n="6">Therefore all the money I have (which, God knows, is a very small stock)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-7" n="7">I keep in my pocket tied about my middle, next my smock.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-8" n="8">So, when I went to put up my purse, as God would have it, my smock was unripped;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-9" n="9">And, instead of putting it into my pocket, down it slipped:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-10" n="10">Then the bell rung, and I went down to put my Lady to bed;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-11" n="11">And, God knows, I thought my money was as safe as my maidenhead.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-12" n="12">So, when I came up again, I found my pocket feel very light,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-13" n="13">But when I searched, and missed my purse, Lord! I thought I should have sunk outright:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-14" n="14">Lord! Madam, says Mary, how d'ye do? Indeed, said I, never worse;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-15" n="15">But pray, Mary, can you tell what I have done with my purse?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-16" n="16">Lord help me, said Mary, I never stirred out of this place!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-17" n="17">Nay, said I, I had it in Lady Betty's chamber, that's a plain case.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-18" n="18">So Mary got me to bed, and covered me up warm,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-19" n="19">However, she stole away my garters, that I might do myself no harm.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-20" n="20">So I tumbled and tossed all night, as you may very well think;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever set my eyes together, or slept a wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-22" n="22">So I was a-dreamed, methought, that we went and searched the folks round;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-23" n="23">And in a corner of Mrs Duke's box, tied in a rag, the money was found.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-24" n="24">So next morning we told Whittle, and he fell a-swearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-25" n="25">Then my Dame Wadgar came, and she, you know, is thick of hearing:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-26" n="26">Dame, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a loss I have had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she, my Lord Collway's folks are all very sad,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-28" n="28">For my Lord Dromedary comes a Tuesday without fail;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-29" n="29">Pugh, said I, but that's not the business that I ail.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-30" n="30">Says Cary, says he, I have been a servant this five and twenty years, come spring,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-31" n="31">And in all the places I lived, I never heard of such a thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-32" n="32">Yes, says the steward, I remember when I was at my Lady Shrewsbury's,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-33" n="33">Such a thing as this happened, just about the time of gooseberries.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-34" n="34">So I went to the party suspected, and I found her full of grief;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-35" n="35">(Now you must know, of all things in the world, I hate a thief.)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolved to bring the discourse slily about,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-37" n="37">Mrs Dukes, said I, here's an ugly accident has happened out;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I value the money three skips of a louse;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-39" n="39">But the thing I stand upon, is the credit of the house;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-40" n="40">'Tis true, seven pound, four shillings, and six pence, makes a great hole in my wages;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, service is no inheritance in these ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-42" n="42">Now, Mrs Dukes, you know, and everybody understands,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-43" n="43">That though 'tis hard to judge, yet money can't go without hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-44" n="44">The Devil take me, said she (blessing herself), if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-45" n="45">So she roared like a Bedlam, as though I had called her all to naught;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-46" n="46">So you know, what could I say to her any more:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-47" n="47">I e'en left her, and came away as wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-48" n="48">Well: but then they would have had me gone to the cunning-man;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis the same thing, the chaplain will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-50" n="50">So the chaplain came in. Now the servants say he is my sweetheart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-51" n="51">Because he's always in my chamber, and I always take his part;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-52" n="52">So, as the Devil would have it, before I was aware, out I blundered,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-53" n="53">Parson, said I, can you cast a nativity, when a body's plundered?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-54" n="54">(Now you must know, he hates to be called 'Parson' like the devil.)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-55" n="55">Truly, says he, Mrs Nab, it might become you to be more civil:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-56" n="56">If your money be gone, as a learned divine says, d'ye see,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-57" n="57">You are no text for my handling, so take that from me;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-58" n="58">I was never taken for a conjuror before, I'd have you to know.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-59" n="59">Lord, said I, don't be angry, I am sure I never thought you so;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-60" n="60">You know, I honour the cloth, I design to be a parson's wife,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-61" n="61">I never took one in your coat for a conjuror in all my life.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-62" n="62">With that, he twisted his girdle at me like a rope, as who should say,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-63" n="63">Now you may go hang yourself for me, and so went away.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-64" n="64">Well; I thought I should have swooned: Lord, said I, what shall I do?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-65" n="65">I have lost my money; and I shall lose my true-love too.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-66" n="66">So, my Lord called me; Harry, said my Lord, don't cry,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-67" n="67">I'll give something towards thy loss; and says my Lady, so will I.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-68" n="68">Oh but, said I, what if after all, the chaplain won't come to?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-69" n="69">For that, he said (an't please your Excellencies) I must petition you.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-70" n="70"><lb/>The premises tenderly considered, I desire your Excellencies' protection,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-71" n="71">And that I may have a share in next Sunday's collection:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-72" n="72">And over and above, that I may have your Excellencies' letter,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-73" n="73">With an order for the chaplain aforesaid; or instead of him, a better.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-74" n="74">And then your poor petitioner, both night and day,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-ROGP-line-75" n="75">Or the chaplain (for 'tis his trade) as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</l>
