            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-29" n="29">On tuesday the ninth seditiously came,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-30" n="30">With a certain false traitress, one Stella by name;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-31" n="31">To the Deanry house, &amp; on the North glass,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-32" n="32">Where for fear of the cold, I never can pass;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-33" n="33">Then &amp; there, vi et armis, with a certain utensil,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-34" n="34">Of value 5 shillings, in English a pencil;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-35" n="35">Did maliciously, falsely, &amp; traiterously write,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-36" n="36">Whilst Stella aforesaid stood by with a light;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-37" n="37">My Sister has lately depos'd upon oath,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-38" n="38">That she stop'd in her course to look on 'em both;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-39" n="39">That Stella was helping, abetting &amp; aiding,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-40" n="40">And still as he writ, stood smiling and reading;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-41" n="41">That her eyes were as bright as my self at noon day,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-42" n="42">But her graceful black locks were mingled with grey;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-43" n="43">And by the description I certainly know,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-44" n="44">T'is the Nymph whom I courted some ten years agoe;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-45" n="45">Whom when I with the best of my talents endued,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-46" n="46">on her promise of yielding; she acted the Prude;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-47" n="47">That some verses were writ with felonious intent,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-48" n="48">Direct to the north where I never went;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-49" n="49">That the letters appear'd revers'd on the Pane,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-50" n="50">But in Stella's bright eyes were plac'd right again;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-51" n="51">Wherein she distinctly cou'd read ev'ry line,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-52" n="52">And presently guess'd the fancy was mine;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-53" n="53">She can swear to the person, whom oft she has seen,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-54" n="54">At night between cavan-street &amp; colledge green;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-55" n="55">Now you see why his verses so seldom are shewn,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-56" n="56">The reason is plain they're none of his own;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-57" n="57">And observe while you live, that no man is shy,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-58" n="58">To discover the Goods he came honestly by;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-59" n="59">If I light on a thought he will certainly steal it,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-60" n="60">And when he has got it, finds ways to conceal it;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-61" n="61">of all the fine things he keeps in the dark,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-62" n="62">There's Scarce one in ten, but what has my mark;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-63" n="63">An let 'em be seen by the world if he dare,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-64" n="64">I'll make it appear they're all stolen ware;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-65" n="65">But as for the Poem he writ on the Sash,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-66" n="66">I think I have now got him under my lash;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-67" n="67">My sister transcrib'd it last night to his Sorrow,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-68" n="68">And the publick shall see it, if I live till to morrow;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-69" n="69">Thro' the Zodiack around it shall quickly be spread,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-70" n="70">In all parts of the globe, where your language is read;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-71" n="71">He knows very well I ne're gave a refusal,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-72" n="72">When he ask'd for my aid, in the forms that are usual,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-73" n="73">But the Secret is this, I did lately intend</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-74" n="74">To write a few verses on you as my friend;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-75" n="75">I study'd a fortnight, before I cou'd find,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-76" n="76">As I rode in my chariot, a thought to my mind;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-77" n="77">And resolv'd the next winter, for that is my time,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-78" n="78">When the days are at shortest, to put it in Rhyme;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-79" n="79">Till then it was lock'd in my box at Parnassus;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-80" n="80">When your subtle Companion, in hopes to surpass us,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-81" n="81">Conveys out my paper of hints by a trick.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-82" n="82">For I think in my conscience, he deals with old Nick,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-83" n="83">And from my own stock provided with topicks,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-84" n="84">He gets to a window beyond both the tropicks;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-85" n="85">There out of my sight, just against the north zone,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-86" n="86">Writes down my conceits, &amp; calls 'em his own;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-87" n="87">And you like a booby the bubble can swallow,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-88" n="88">Now who but Delany can write like Apollo;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-89" n="89">High-treason by statute!── but here you object,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-90" n="90">He only stole hints, the verse is correct;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-91" n="91">Tho' the thoughts be Apollo's, t'is finely express'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-92" n="92">So a thief steals my horse, &amp; gets him well dress'd</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-93" n="93"><lb/>Now whereas the s<hi rend="superscript">ḍ</hi> criminal seems past repentance,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-94" n="94">We Phœbus think fitt to proceed to his sentence;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-95" n="95">Since Delany has dar'd like Prometheus his Sire,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-96" n="96">To climb to our region, &amp; there to steal fire;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-97" n="97">We order a vulture, in shape of the Spleen,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-98" n="98">To prey on his liver, but not to be seen;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-99" n="99">And we order our Subjects of ev'ry degree,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-100" n="100">To beleive all his verses were written by me;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-101" n="101">And under the pain of our highest displeasure,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-102" n="102">To call nothing his but the Rhyme &amp; the measure</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-103" n="103">And lastly for Stella, just out of her prime,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-104" n="104">I am too much reveng'd already by time;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-105" n="105">In return to her scorn, I send her diseases,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-106" n="106">And will now be her friend, when-ever She pleases;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-107" n="107">And the gifts I bestow'd her, will find her a lover,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-310L-line-108" n="108">Tho' she lives till she's grey as a badger all over.</l>
