This living he swapped soon after for a chaplain's post in a regiment, which he sold for five hundred pounds. He turned his hand with this money, and in a very little time got a deanry; this he swapped likewise for another living. After this again he got another deanry, by some unaccountable methods: but, being much in debt, he was forced to fly his <hi rend="italics">country</hi>; and disposed of it, in what manner nobody can tell, but himself and another. He has left one living behind him, which he could not avoid doing, because it was sequestered for his debts. When he went for <hi rend="italics">England</hi>, in order to turn the penny, he received subscriptions from numbers of gentlemen, to carry on a work, which would have taken ten years to accomplish, if the most ingenious and learned person had undertaken it, and which he himself could not have done in ten thousand years. After all this, he ran off to <hi rend="italics">Fort St. George</hi>, and left the following character of himself. <hi rend="italics">This from the Political State for the Month of</hi> February 1729, p. 209. About the same time it was published (in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Post</hi> of <hi rend="italics">February</hi> 13) that a <hi rend="italics">mezzotinto</hi> was engraving from an original picture of D<hi rend="small-caps">EAN </hi>S<hi rend="small-caps">MEDLEY</hi>, with this remarkable inscription, written by himself:</l>
