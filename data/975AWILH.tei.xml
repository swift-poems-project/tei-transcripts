            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-4" n="4">When into my hands comes a letter from the droll.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-5" n="5">I can't pray in quiet for you and your verses,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-6" n="6">But now let us hear what the Muse from your car says.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-9" n="9">But let me advise you, when next I hear from you,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-10" n="10">To leave off this passion which does not become you:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-11" n="11">For we who debate on a subject important,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-12" n="12">Must argue with calmness, or else will come short on't.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-13" n="13">For myself, I protest, I care not a fiddle</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-14" n="14">For a riddle and sieve, or a sieve and a riddle:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-15" n="15">And think of the sex as you please, I'd as lieve</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-16" n="16">You call them a riddle, as call them a sieve.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-18" n="18">For I'll prove it impossible they can be both.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-19" n="19">A school-boy knows this, for it plainly appears</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-20" n="20">That a sieve dissolves riddles by help of the shears;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-21" n="21">For you can't but have heard of a trick among wizards,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-22" n="22">To break open riddles with shears or with scissars.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-23" n="23">Think again of the sieve, and I'll hold you a wager,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-26" n="26">Like a woman it keeps in less than it lets out.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-27" n="27">Why sure, Mr. Poet, your head got a jar</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-28" n="28">By riding this morning too long in your car:</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-30" n="30">For the sake of your senses wou'd lay an embargo.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-31" n="31">You threaten the stocks: I say you are scurrilous,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-32" n="32">And you durst not talk thus if I saw you at our ale-house.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-33" n="33">But as for your threats, you may do what you can,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-34" n="34">I despise any poet that truckled to Dan.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-35" n="35">But keep a good tongue, or you'll find, to your smart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-36" n="36">From rhyming in cars you may swing in a cart.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-37" n="37">You found out my rebus with very much modesty;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-38" n="38">But thanks to the lady: I'm sure she's too good to ye;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-39" n="39">Till she lent you her help, you were in a fine twitter :</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-40" n="40">You hit it, you say,── you're a delicate hitter.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-41" n="41">How could you forget so ungratefully a lass?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-42" n="42">And if you be my Phœbus, pray who was your Pallas?</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-43" n="43">As for your new rebus, or riddle, or crux,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-44" n="44">I will either explain, or repay it by trucks;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-45" n="45">Tho' your lords, and your dogs, and your catches, methinks,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-46" n="46">Are harder than ever were put by the Sphinx.</l>
            <l rend="indent(1)" xml:id="swift-975AWILH-line-47" n="47">And thus I am fully reveng'd for your late tricks,</l>
