Patrick's. Upon which, thirty one of the principal inhabitants of the liberty of the dean and chapter of S. Patrick's, signed a Paper, to this effect: `That out of their great love and respect to the dean, to whom the whole kingdom hath so many obligations, they would endeavour to defend the life and limbs of the said dean, against a certain man, and all his ruffians and murderers'. With which Paper, they, in the name of themselves, and all the inhabitants of the said Liberty, attended the dean on January the 8th; who being extremely ill in bed of a giddiness and deafness, and not able to receive them, immediately dictated a very grateful answer, which was published in my brother F<hi rend="small-caps">OG</hi>'s last <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>. The occasion of the <hi rend="italics">certain man</hi>'s declaration of his villainous design against the dean, was a frivolous unproved suspicion, that he had written some lines in verse reflecting upon him; of which the following is a genuine copy, sent from Ireland to a gentleman here.</l>

              <l n="1" xml:id="spp-811-34RB-headnote-2-line-group-1-line-1">	After I had sent these verses to the press, I was informed by a book-seller, that they had been printed in a thing called a <hi rend="italics">Supplement to the Gentleman's Magazine</hi>. But as that piratical compilation is read much more in the country, than in town; I imagined, that our sensible and judicious readers, who are always for going to the fountain-head, would not probably, unless by mere chance, ever see these verses in the <hi rend="italics">Supplement</hi>. The barbarous threats of the <hi rend="italics">certain man</hi> against the dean, and the affectionate zeal of so many persons in his defence, having made a great noise, and excited a great curiosity to know the original cause of both; to satisfy this curiosity, was the sole end of publishing the verses here, without any more approbation of them, than of the intended assassination or mutilation to which they gave occasion. <lb/> <note rend="flush right">B<hi rend="small-caps">AVIUS</hi>.</note></l>
