            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-1" n="1">I sing not of the Drapier's praise, nor yet of William Wood;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-2" n="2">But I sing of a famous lord, who seeks his country's good.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-3" n="3">Lord William's Grace of Dublin town, 'tis he that first appears,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-4" n="4">Whose wisdom and whose piety, do far exceed his years.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-5" n="5">In every council and debate he stands for what is right;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-6" n="6">And still the truth he will maintain, whate'er he loses by't.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-7" n="7">And though some think him in the wrong, yet still there comes a season</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-8" n="8">When everyone turns round about, and owns His Grace had reason.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-9" n="9">His firmness to the public good, as one that knows it swore,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-10" n="10">Has lost His Grace for ten years past ten thousand pounds and more:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-11" n="11">Then come the poor and strip him so, they leave him not a cross,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-12" n="12">For he regards ten thousand pounds no more than Woods's dross.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-13" n="13">To beg his favour is the way new favours still to win,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-14" n="14">He makes no more to give ten pounds than Ito give a pin.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-15" n="15">Why, there's my landlord now the squire, who all in money wallows,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-16" n="16">He would not give a groat to save his father from the gallows.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-17" n="17">'A bishop', says the noble squire, 'I hate the very name,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-18" n="18">To have two thousand pounds a year, O 'tis a burning shame!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-19" n="19">Two thousand pounds a year, good lord! and Ito have but five.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-20" n="20">And under him no tenant yet was ever known to thrive.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-21" n="21">Now from his lordship's Grace I hold a little piece of ground,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-22" n="22">And all the rent I pay is scarce five shillings in the pound.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-23" n="23">Then master steward takes my rent, and tells me, 'Honest Jo,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-24" n="24">Come you must take a cup of sack or two before you go.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-25" n="25">He bids me then to hold my tongue, and up the money locks,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-26" n="26">For fear my lord should send it all into the poor man's box.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-27" n="27">And once I was so bold to beg that I might see His Grace,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-28" n="28">Good lord! I wondered how I dared to look him in the face.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-29" n="29">Then down I went upon my knees, his blessing to obtain,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-30" n="30">He gave it me, and ever since I find I thrive amain.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-31" n="31">Then said my lord, 'I'm very glad to see thee honest friend,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-32" n="32">I know the times are something hard, but hope they soon will mend,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-33" n="33">Pray never press yourself for rent, but pay me when you can,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-34" n="34">I find you bear a good report, and are an honest man.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-35" n="35">Then said his lordship with a smile, 'I must have lawful cash,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-36" n="36">I hope you will not pay my rent in that same Woods's trash.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-37" n="37">'God bless your Grace,' I then replied, 'I'd see him hanging higher,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-38" n="38">Before I touched his filthy dross, than is Clondalkin spire.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-39" n="39">To every farmer twice a week all round about the yoke,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-40" n="40">Our parsons read the Drapier's books, and make us honest folk.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-41" n="41">And then I went to pay the squire and in the way I found,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-42" n="42">His bailie driving all my cows into the parish pound.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-43" n="43">'Why sirrah,' said the noble squire, 'how dare you see my face,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-44" n="44">Your rent is due almost a week beside the days of grace.'</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-45" n="45">And yet the land I from him hold is set so on the rack,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-46" n="46">That only for the bishop's lease 'twould quickly break my back.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-47" n="47">Then God preserve his lordship's Grace, and make him live as long</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-341-ROGP-line-48" n="48">As did Methusalem of old, and so I end my song.</l>
