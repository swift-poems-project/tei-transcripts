Many of the gentlemen assembled in this groupe had a genius for poetry, and a taste for the polite arts. In this retirement they passed their hours very agreeably, and frequently amused themselves with poetical jests and whimsies of the brain, which undoubtedly were never designed originally for the press. However, since, by one means or other, several of those ingenious rapid performances have already appeared in some of the former volumes of Doctor Swift's works, it is hoped the two or three following copies of verses, which were communicated to the Editor of these volumes by a gentleman who had them long in his possession, will not meet with an ungracious reception from persons of taste and refinement</note> NIM-DAN-DEAN's<lb/>  INVITATION <ref target="#spp-X22-1351-footnote-title-2">2</ref><note n="2" xml:id="spp-X22-1351-footnote-title-2" place="foot">This Invitation seems to have been the joint composition of George Rochfort, John Rochfort, (who was called Nim, or Nimrod, by Doctor Swift, because he was fond of hunting) Dan Jackson, and Doctor Swift, in a vein of whim and merriment; and, in all probability, was sent off directly by the post to Sheridan</note><lb/>  TO<lb/>  M<hi rend="small-caps">R</hi>.

            <l xml:id="swift-X22-1351-line-10" n="10">That wrote the Prologue<note place="foot">·It was customary with Doctor Sheridan to have a Greek play acted by his head class just before they entered the University; and accordingly, in the year 1720, the Doctor having fixed on Hippolytus, writ a prologue in English, to be spoken by Master Tom Putland, one of the youngest children he had in his school. The prologue was very neat and elegant, but extremely puerile, and quite adapted to the childhood of the speaker, who as regularly was taught, and rehearsed his part, as any of the upper lads did theirs. However, it unfortunately happened, that Doctor King, Archbishop of Dublin, had promised Sheridan that he would go and see his lads perform the tragedy. Upon which Doctor Helsham writ another prologue, wherein he laughed egregiously at Sheridan's, and privately instructed Master Putland how to act his part; and, at the same time, exacted a promise from the child, that no consideration should make him repeat that prologue which he had been taught by Sheridan. When the play was to be acted, the Archbishop attended according to his promise, and Master Putland began Helsham's prologue, and went through it to the amazement of Sheridan; which fired him to such a degree, (although he was one of the best-natured men in the world) that he would have entirely put off the play, had it not been in respect to the Archbishop, who was indeed highly complimented in Helsham's performance. When the play was over, the Archbishop was very desirous to hear Sheridan's prologue; but all the entreaties of the Archbishop, the child's father, and Sheridan, could not prevail with Master Putland to repeat it, having, he said, promised faithfully that he would not, upon any account whatever; and therefore insisted that he would keep his word.</note>, and if you stay with him, depend on't, in the <hi rend="italics">end, he'll sham ye</hi>.</l>
