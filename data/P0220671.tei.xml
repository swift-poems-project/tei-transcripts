I mean, that of <hi rend="italics">Turnups</hi>; not of <hi rend="italics">Turnips</hi>, according to the best Orthography, but absolutely <hi rend="italics">Turnups</hi>. Although this Cry be of an older Date than some of the preceding Enormities, for it begun soon after the Revolution; yet was it never known to arrive at so great an Height, as during the Earl of <hi rend="italics">Oxford</hi>'s Power. Some People, (whom I take to be private Enemies) are, indeed, as ready as my self to profess their Disapprobation of this Cry, on Pretence that it began by the Contrivance of certain old Procuresses, who kept Houses of ill Fame, where lewd Women met to draw young Men into Vice. And this they pretend to prove by some Words in the Cry; because, after the Cryer had bawled out <hi rend="italics">Turnups, ho, buy my dainty Turnups</hi>, he would sometimes add the two following Verses.</l>
