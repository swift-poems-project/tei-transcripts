            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-2" n="2">And I had in a Purse, 7<hi rend="superscript">lḷ</hi> and 4<hi rend="superscript">s</hi> (besides Farthings) in Money and Gold;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-3" n="3">So because I had been buying things for My Lady last Night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-4" n="4">I was resolv'd to tell my Money, to see if it was right:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-5" n="5">Now You must know, because my Trunk has a very bad Lock, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-6" n="6">Therefore all the Money I have, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi> God knows is a Very small stock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-7" n="7">I keep in a Pocket ty'd about my Middle, next my Smock.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-8" n="8">So when I put up my Purse, as God wou'd have it, my smock was unript,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-9" n="9">And instead of putting it into My Pocket, down it slipt:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-10" n="10">Then the Bell rung, and I went down stairs to put my Lady to Bed,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-11" n="11">When, God knows, I thought my Money was as safe as my Maiden-head.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-12" n="12">om.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-13" n="13">But when I search'd, and miss'd My Purse, Lord! I thought I shou'd have sunk outright.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-14" n="14">Lord! Madam, says Mary, how d'yee do? Indeed says I, never worse;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-15" n="15">But pray, Mary, can Y<hi rend="superscript">u</hi> tell what I have done with My Purse!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-16" n="16">Lord help me, said Mary, I never stirr'd out of this Place!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-17" n="17">Nay, said I, I had it in Lady Betty's Chamber, that's a plain case.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-18" n="18">So Mary got me to Bed, and Cover'd me up Warm,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-19" n="19">However She stole away by Garters, y<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> I might do My self no harm:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-20" n="20">So I tumbl'd and toss'd all night, as Y<hi rend="superscript">ụ</hi> may very well think,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever set my Eyes together, or slept a Wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-22" n="22">So I was dream'd, Methought that we Went and search'd y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> folks round,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-23" n="23">And in a Corner of M<hi rend="superscript">rṣ</hi> Duke's Box, ty'd in a Rag, y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> money was found.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-24" n="24">So next morning We told Whittle, and he fell a swearing,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-25" n="25">Then M<hi rend="superscript">rṣ</hi> Wadgar came, and she, Y<hi rend="superscript">ụ</hi> know is thick of hearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-26" n="26">Dame, said I, as loud as I cou'd Bawl, do You know what a loss I have had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she, my Lord <note place="foot">·Gallway.</note> Collway's Folks are all Very sad,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-28" n="28">For my L<hi rend="superscript">ḍ</hi> <note place="foot">·Drogheda.</note> Dromedary comes a Tuesd: without fail;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-29" n="29">Pugh! said I, but that's not the Business that I ail.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-30" n="30">Says Cary, says he, I have been a serv<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>: this 5 and Twenty Years come spring</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-31" n="31">And in all the Places I Liv'd, I never heard of such a thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-32" n="32">Yes, says the Steward, when I was at My Lady Shrewsbury's</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-33" n="33">Such a thing as this happen'd just about the Time of Goosberries.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-34" n="34">So I went to the Party suspected, and found Her full of Grief,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-35" n="35">Now You know, of all things in the World, I hate a Thief:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolv'd to bring the discourse slily about,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-37" n="37">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes, said I, here's an ugly Accident has happen'd out;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I Value the Money three Skips of a Louse.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-39" n="39">But the thing I stand upon, is the Credit of the house;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-40" n="40">Tis true 7<hi rend="superscript">lḷ</hi> and 4<hi rend="superscript">ṣ</hi> and 6<hi rend="superscript">ḍ</hi> makes a great Hole in my Wages,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-41" n="41">Besides as they say, Service is no Inheritance in these Ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-42" n="42">Now, M<hi rend="superscript">rṣ</hi> Dukes, You know and ev'ry body understands</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-43" n="43">That tho' tis hard to Judge-- Money cannot go without hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-44" n="44">The Devil take me, says she, Blessing her self, if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-45" n="45">So she Roar'd like a Bedlam, as tho' I had call'd her to naught;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-46" n="46">So You know, what cou'd I say to her any more,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-47" n="47">I e'en Left her, and came away as Wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-48" n="48">Well: but then they wou'd have had me Gone to the Cunning-Man;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis the same Thing, The <note place="foot">·Doc<hi rend="superscript">tṛ</hi> Jonath<hi rend="superscript">n</hi>: Swift then Chaplain to L<hi rend="superscript">ḍ</hi> Berkly (one of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> L<hi rend="superscript">d'ṣ</hi> Justices) and suppos'd Author of this whimsical and humorous Petition.</note> Chaplain will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-50" n="50">So the Chaplain came in; Now the Serv<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>: say he is my Sweet-heart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-51" n="51">Because he's always in My Chamber, and I allways take his part;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-52" n="52">So, as the Devil wou'd have it, before I was Aware, out I Blunder'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-53" n="53">Parson, said I, can You cast a Nativity? when a Body's Plunder'd?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-54" n="54">Now You must know, he hates to be call'd Parson like the Devil,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-55" n="55">Truly, said he M<hi rend="superscript">rṣ</hi> Nab, it might become You to be more civil:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-56" n="56">If Your Money begone, as a Learned Divine says, d'Ye see,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-57" n="57">You are no Text for my handling, take that from Me:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-58" n="58">I was never taken for a Conjurer before, I'd have You to know.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-59" n="59">Lord, said I, don't be Angry, I'm sure I never thought You so;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-60" n="60">You know I honour y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Cloth, I design to be a Parson's Wife,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-61" n="61">I never took One in Y<hi rend="superscript">ṛ</hi> Coat for a Conjurer in all My Life.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-62" n="62">With that he Twisted his Girdle like a Rope, as who shou'd say,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-63" n="63">Now You may go hang Your self for Me, and so went away.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-64" n="64">Well I thought I shou'd have swoon'd; Lord, said I, what shall I do?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-65" n="65">I have lost My Money, and shall loose My True Love too.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-66" n="66">Then My Lord call'd me; Harris, said My Lord, don't Cry,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-67" n="67">I'll give something towards thy Loss; and says my Lady, so will I.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-68" n="68">Oh, but said I, what if after all, My Chaplain won't come to?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-69" n="69">For that he said, (an't please Your Excellencies) I must petition You.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-70" n="70">The Premises tenderly Consider'd, I desire Y<hi rend="superscript">ṛ</hi> Excellencys Protection,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-002D-line-71" n="71">And that I may have a share in next Sunday's Collection:</l>
