My ingenious Kinsman Mr. <hi rend="italics">Humphrey Wagstaff</hi>, who treats of every Subject after a Manner that no other Author has done, and better than any other can do, has sent me the Description of a City Shower. I do not question but the Reader remembers my Cousin's Description of the Morning as it breaks in Town, which is printed in the 9th <hi rend="italics">Tatler</hi>, and is another exquisite Piece of this local Poetry.</l>
