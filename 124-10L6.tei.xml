              <l n="1" xml:id="spp-124-10L6-headnote-1-line-group-1-line-1">But instead of such agreeable Works as these, the Town has this half Age been tormented with Insects call'd <hi rend="italics">Easie Writers</hi>, whose Abilities Mr. <hi rend="italics">Wycherly</hi> one Day describ'd excellently well in one Word: <hi rend="italics">That, </hi>said he<hi rend="italics">, among these Fellows is call'd </hi>Easy Writing<hi rend="italics">, which any one may easily write</hi>. Such Janty Scriblers are so justly laugh'd at for their Sonnets on <hi rend="italics">Phillis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Chloris</hi>, and Fantastical Descriptions in 'em, that an ingenious Kinsman of mine, of the Family of the <hi rend="italics">Staffs</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italics">Humphrey Wagstaff</hi> by Name, has, to avoid their Strain, run into a Way perfectly new, and describ'd Things exactly as they happen: He never forms Fields, or Nymphs, or Groves, where they are not, but makes the Incidents just as they really appear. For an Example of it; I stole out of his Manuscript the following Lines: They are a Description of the Morning, but of the Morning in Town; nay, of the Morning at this end of the Town, where my Kinsman at present lodges.</l>

Therefore, before-hand, I barr all Descriptions of the Evening; as, a Medley of Verses signifying Grey Peas are now cri'd warm; That Wenches now begin to amble round the Passages of the Play-house: Or of Noon; as, That fine Ladies and great Beaux are just yawning out of their Beds and Windows in <hi rend="italics">Pall-Mall</hi>, and so forth. I forewarn also all Persons from encouraging any Draughts after my Cousin; and foretel any Man who shall go about to imitate him, that he will be very insipid.</l>
