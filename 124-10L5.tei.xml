Such Jantie Scribblers are so justly laughed at for their Sonnets on <hi rend="italics">Phillis</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Chloris</hi>, and Fantastical Descriptions in 'em, that an ingenious Kinsman of mine, of the Family of the <hi rend="italics">Staffs</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italics">Humphrey Wagstaff</hi> by Name, has, to avoid their Strain, run into a Way perfectly new, and described Things exactly as they happen: He never forms Fields, or Nymphs, or Groves, where they are not, but makes the Incidents just as they really appear. For an Example of it; I stole out of his Manuscript the following Lines: They are a Description of the Morning, but of the Morning in Town; nay, of the Morning at this End of the Town, where my Kinsman at present lodges.</l>

Therefore, before-hand, I bar all Descriptions of the Evening; as, a Medley of Verses signifying, Grey-Peas are now cried warm: That Wenches now begin to amble round the Passages of the Play-house: Or of Noon; as, That fine Ladies and great Beaus are just yawning out of their Beds and Windows in <hi rend="italics">Pall-Mall</hi>, and so forth. I forewarn also all Persons from encouraging any Draughts after my Cousin; and foretell any Man who shall go about to imitate him, that he will be very insipid.</l>
