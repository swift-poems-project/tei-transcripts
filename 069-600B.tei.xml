            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-2" n="2">And I had in my Purse, 7, 4, 6 besides farthings, in Mony, &amp; Gold;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-3" n="3">So, because I had been buying things for my Lady, last night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-4" n="4">I was resolv'd to tell my Mony, to see if it was right.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-5" n="5">Now you must know, because my Trunk has a very bad lock, 3}</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-6" n="6">Therefore all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Mony, I have, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, God knows, is a very small stock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-7" n="7">I keep in a pocket, tyd about my Middle, next my Smock.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-8" n="8">So when I went to put up my purse, as God would have \<hi rend="italics">add</hi>·it\, my smock was unrip\<hi rend="italics">add</hi>·t.\</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-9" n="9">And, instead of putting it into my Pocket, down it slipt:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-10" n="10">Then y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Bell rung, &amp; I went \<hi rend="italics">add</hi>·down\ to put my Lady to bed,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-11" n="11">And, God knows, I thought my Mony as safe as my Maidenhead.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-12" n="12">So when I came up again, I found my Pocket feel very light,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-13" n="13">But when I searc'd, &amp; miss'd my Purse, Lord! I thought I shoud have sunk dowright</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-18" n="18">So Mary got me to bed, &amp; cover'd me up warm,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-19" n="19">However, she stole away my Garters, that I might do my self no harm:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-20" n="20">So I tumbled, &amp; toss'd all night, as you may very well think,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever set my Eyes together, or slept a wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-22" n="22">So I was a·Dream'd, methought, we went, &amp; search'd y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Folk round,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-24" n="24">So next Morning we told Whittle, &amp; he fell a swearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-25" n="25">Then my Dame Wadgar came, &amp; she, you know, is thick of hearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-26" n="26">Dame, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a loss Ive had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she. My Lord Collways Folks are all very sad,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-28" n="28">For My Lord Dromedary comes a Tuesday without fail;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-29" n="29">Pugh! said I, but y<hi rend="superscript">t</hi> is not y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> thing I ail</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-30" n="30">Says Cary, says he, I have been a servant, this 25 years, come spring,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-31" n="31">And, in all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> places I liv'd in, I never heard of such a thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-32" n="32">Yes, said y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Steward, I remember when J was at my Lady Shrewsburies</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-33" n="33">Such a thing as this happen'd, just about y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> time of Goosberries.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-34" n="34">So I went to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Party suspected, &amp; found her full of Greif;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-35" n="35">(Now, you must know, of all things in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> World, I hate a Theif.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolv'd to bring y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Matter slyly about,)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-37" n="37">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes, said I, heres an ugly accident happen'd out;</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, service has no Inheritance in these ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-600B-line-42" n="42">Now, M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes, you know, &amp; every body understands,</l>
