            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-41" n="41">That her Eyes were as bright as myself at Noonday,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-42" n="42">But her graceful black Locks were mingled with grey.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-43" n="43">And by the Description I certainly know,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-44" n="44">'Tis the Nymph, that I courted some ten Years ago:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-45" n="45">Whom, when I with the best of my Talents endu'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-46" n="46">On her Promise of yielding; she acted the Prude.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-47" n="47">That some Verses were writ with felonious Intent,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-48" n="48">Direct to the <hi rend="italics">North</hi>, where I never went;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-49" n="49">That the Letters appear'd, reverse thro' the Pane,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-50" n="50">But in <hi rend="italics">Stella</hi>'s bright Eyes they were plac'd right again;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-51" n="51">Wherein she distinctly could read ev'ry Line,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-55" n="55">Now you see why his Verses so seldom are shown;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-56" n="56">The Reason is plain, they are none of his own;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-57" n="57">And observe, while you live, that no Man is shy</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-58" n="58">To discover the Goods he came honestly by.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-59" n="59">If I light on a Thought, he'll certainly steal it;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-60" n="60">And when he has got it, find Ways to conceal it;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-61" n="61">Of all the fine Things he keeps in the Dark,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-62" n="62">There's scarce one in Ten, but what has my Mark;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-63" n="63">And let them be seen by the World, if he dare,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-64" n="64">I'll make it appear, they are all stolen Ware.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-65" n="65">But as for the Poem he writ on your Sash,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-66" n="66">I think, I have now got him under my Lash;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-67" n="67">My Sister transcrib'd it last Night to his Sorrow,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-68" n="68">And the Publick shall see't, if I live till To-morrow.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-69" n="69">Thro' the <hi rend="italics">Zodiac</hi> around, it shall quickly be spread,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-70" n="70">In all Parts of the Globe, where your Language is read,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-71" n="71">He knows very well, I ne'er gave a Refusal,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-72" n="72">When he ask'd for my Aid in the Forms, that are usual:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-73" n="73">But the Secret is this, I did lately intend</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-74" n="74">To write a few Verses on you, as my Friend;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-75" n="75">I studied a Fortnight, before I could find,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-76" n="76">As I rode in my Chariot, a Thought to my Mind,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-77" n="77">And resolv'd the next Winter, (for that is my Time,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-78" n="78">When the Days are at shortest,) to get it in Rhime;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-79" n="79">'Till then it was lock'd in my Box at <hi rend="italics">Parnassus</hi>:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-80" n="80">When that subtile Companion, in Hopes to surpass us,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-81" n="81">Conveys out my Papers of Hints by a trick,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-82" n="82">(For I think, in my Conscience, he deals with <hi rend="italics">old Nick</hi>,)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-83" n="83">And from my own Stock provided with Topicks,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-84" n="84">He gets to a Window beyond both the Tropicks;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-85" n="85">There out of my Sight, just against the <hi rend="italics">North</hi> Zone,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-86" n="86">Writes down my Conceits, and calls them his own;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-87" n="87">And you, like a Cully, the Bubble can swallow:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-88" n="88">Now, who but <hi rend="italics">Delany</hi>, that writes like <hi rend="italics">Apollo</hi>?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-89" n="89">High Treason by Statute. But here you object,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-90" n="90">He only stole Hints, but the Verse is correct.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-91" n="91">Tho' the Thought be <hi rend="italics">Apollo</hi>'s, 'tis finely express'd:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-92" n="92">So a Thief steals my Horse, and has him well dress'd.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-93" n="93">Now, whereas the said Criminal seems past Repentance,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-94" n="94">We <hi rend="italics">Phœbus</hi> think fit to proceed to the Sentence;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-95" n="95">Since <hi rend="italics">Delany</hi> has dar'd, like <hi rend="italics">Prometheus</hi> his Sire,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-263-0204-line-96" n="96">To climb to our Region, and thence to steal Fire;</l>
