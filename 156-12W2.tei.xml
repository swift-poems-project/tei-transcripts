Swift thus metions it in his journal: “To-day I published `The Fable of Midas,' a poem printed on a loose half sheet of paper. I know not how it will take; but it passed wonderfully at our society to-night; and Mr Secretary read it before me the other night, to lord-treasurer, at Lord Masham's, where they equally apporved of it. Tell me how it passes with you.”────<hi rend="italics">Journal to Stella, Feb</hi>. 14, 1711-12</note></title>
