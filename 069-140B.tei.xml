            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-2" n="2">And I had in a purse seven pounds four shillin\<hi rend="italics">lost·in·gutter</hi>\ &amp; six pence, besides farthings, in money &amp; go\<hi rend="italics">lost·in·gutter</hi>\</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-3" n="3">So because I had been buying things for my Lady last night,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-4" n="4">I was resolv'd to tell my money, to see if it was right:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-5" n="5">Now you must know, because my trunk has a very bad lock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-6" n="6">Therefore all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> money I have, w<hi rend="superscript">ch</hi>, God knows, is a very small stock,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-7" n="7">I keep in my pocket, ty'd about my middle, next my smock.</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-11" n="11">And, God knows, I thought my money was as safe as my maidenhead.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-12" n="12">So when I came up again, I found my pocket feel very light,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-13" n="13">But when I search'd, &amp; miss'd my purse, Lord! I thought I shoud have sunk outright</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-14" n="14">Lord! Madam, says Mary, how d'ye do? indeed says I, never worse:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-15" n="15">But pray, Mary, can you tell what I have don\<hi rend="italics">lost·in·gutter</hi>\ with my purse?</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-20" n="20">So I tumbled &amp; tossd all night, as you may very well think,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-21" n="21">But hardly ever sat my eyes together or slept a wink.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-22" n="22">So I was a·dream'd, methought, that we went &amp; search'd y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> folks round</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-23" n="23">And in a corner of M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes box, ty'd in a rag, y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> money was found.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-24" n="24">So next morning we told Whittle, &amp; he fell a swearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-25" n="25">Then my Dame Wadgar came, &amp; she you know is thick of hearing;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-26" n="26">Dame, said I, as loud as I could bawl, do you know what a Loss I have had?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-27" n="27">Nay, said she, my L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Galways folks are all very sad;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-28" n="28">For my L<hi rend="superscript">d</hi> Drogheda comes a tuesday without fail;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-29" n="29">Pugh! said I but that's not y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> business that I ail.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-30" n="30">Says Cary, says he, I have been a servant this five &amp; twenty years, come spring,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-31" n="31">And in all y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> places I liv'd, I never heard of such a thing.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-32" n="32">Yes, says y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Steward, I remember when I was at my Lady Shrewsbury's,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-33" n="33">Such a thing as this happend, just about y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> time of Goosberries.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-34" n="34">So I went to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> party suspected, &amp; I found her full of grief;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-35" n="35">(Now you must know, of all things in y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> world, I hate a thief.)</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-36" n="36">However, I was resolved to bring y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> discourse slily about;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-37" n="37">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes, said I, here's an ugly accident has happend out:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-38" n="38">'Tis not that I value y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> money three skips of a louse;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-39" n="39">But y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> thing I stand upon is, y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> credit of y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> house\<hi rend="italics">cropped</hi>\</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-40" n="40">'Tis true, seven pounds, four shillings, &amp; six pence, makes a great hole in my wages;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-41" n="41">Besides, as they say, service is no inheritance in these ages.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-42" n="42">Now M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Dukes, you know, &amp; every body understands,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-43" n="43">That tho 'tis hard to judge, yet money can't go without hands.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-44" n="44">The Devil take me said she (blessing herself) if ever I saw't!</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-45" n="45">So she roar'd like a bedlam, as tho I had calld her all to naught:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-46" n="46">So you know, what cou'd I say to her any more;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-47" n="47">I e'n left her, &amp; came away as wise as I was before.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-48" n="48">Well: but then they would have had me gone to y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Cunning man;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-49" n="49">No, said I, 'tis y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> same thing y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Chaplain will be here anon.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-50" n="50">So y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Chaplain came in: now y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> servants say he is my sweetheart,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-51" n="51">Because he's always in my chamber, &amp; I always take his part;</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-52" n="52">So, as y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Devil would have it, before I was aware, out I blunder'd,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-53" n="53">Parson, said I, can you cast a Nativity, when a body's plunderd?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-54" n="54">Now you must know he hates to be calld parson like y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> Devil,</l>

            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-58" n="58">I was never taken for a conjurer before, Id have you to know:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-59" n="59">Lord, said I, don't be angry, I am sure I never thought you so:</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-60" n="60">You know, I honour y<hi rend="superscript">e</hi> cloth, I design to be a Parson's wife,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-61" n="61">I never took one in your coat for a conjurer in all my life.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-62" n="62">With that, he twisted his girdle at me like a rope, as who shou'd say,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-63" n="63">Now you may go hang yourself for me, &amp; so went away.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-64" n="64">Well, I thought I shou'd have swoon'd; Lord, said I, what shall I do?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-65" n="65">I have lost my money, &amp; shall lose my truelove too.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-66" n="66">Then my Lord calld me; Harry said my Lord, don't cry,</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-67" n="67">Ill give something towards thy loss, &amp; says my Lady, so will I.</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-68" n="68">Oh! but said I, what if after all my Chaplain wont come to?</l>
            <l xml:id="swift-069-140B-line-69" n="69">For that he said, (an't please your Excellencies,) I must petition you.</l>
